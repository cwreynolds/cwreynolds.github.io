I am [Craig Reynolds](http://www.red3d.com/cwr) and I am now officially **retired**.

I was born in 1953. I began working professionally in 1975 and—with only occasional gaps—continued until December 2019. At first I was interested in the commercial world, especially bringing the new technology of computer graphics and animation to the feature film industry. I also began attending research conferences, beginning with SIGGRAPH. My interest in research grew and my interest in commercial software applications fell. Finally I am able to focus my efforts on research.

Now I am returning to work that I had to put on the shelf in 2011. It relates to evolutionary texture synthesis and adversarial learning—using the evolution of camouflage as a motivating example. My first publication on this topic was [Interactive Evolution of Camouflage](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/iec/) in 2010 and 2011.

Initially I will concentrate on [TexSyn](https://github.com/cwreynolds/TexSyn) a new library for procedural texture synthesis. It will borrow from and update my previous design begun in 2008: [Texture Synthesis Diary](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/texsyn/diary.html). I will describe my progress in future blog posts here.
